{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Install the project

```
git clone https://github.com/kornia/bubbaloop.git

## Serve in local

Launch the server via the terminal; it defaults to listening on `0.0.0.0:3000`

```
just serve
```

You might observe something like this:

```bash
[2025-01-04T23:14:46Z INFO bubbaloop::api] ðŸš€ Starting the server
[2025-01-04T23:14:46Z INFO bubbaloop::api] ðŸ”¥ Listening on: 0.0.0.0:3000
[2025-01-04T23:14:46Z INFO bubbaloop::api] ðŸ”§ Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

## Serve remotely

Repeat the process about in a remote machine (e.g. in Nvidia Jetson) and give a `HOST`and an `IP` to serve remotely.

```bash
just serve 192.168.1.154 3000
```

## Use the CLI

```bash
just help
```

```bash
Usage: bubbaloop [-h <host>] [-p <port>] <command> [<args>]

Bubbaloop CLI

Options:
  -h, --host        the host to listen on
  -p, --port        the port to listen on
  --help, help      display usage information
