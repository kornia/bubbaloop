# üç∞ Pipelines

Bubbaloop can serve local pipeline orchestrated by copper-rs[^1] which are defined by ron[^2] files.

## Start pipeline

Create and register a pipeline given its name. This will spawn a background task.

```
just pipeline-start HOST IP PIPE_NAME
```

```bash
Result: {
  "message": "Pipeline started"
}
```

## Stop pipeline

To stop the pipeline, use the `pipeline-stop` command:

```
just pipeline-stop HOST IP PIPE_NAME
```

```bash
Result: {
  "message": "Pipeline bubbaloop stopped"
}
```

## List pipelines

To list all the registered pipelines and their status, use the `pipeline-list` command:

```
just pipeline-list HOST IP
```

```bash
Result: [
  {
    "id": "bubbaloop",
    "status": "Running",
    "thread_name": ""
  }
]
```
